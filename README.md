This is a [python library](api.md) to facilitate analyses and methods development of genetics data from admixed populations. We also have [command line interface](cli/index.md) for main functions. We welcome [feature requests or bug reports](https://github.com/KangchengHou/admix-kit/issues). 


## Installation
```bash
# Install admix-kit with Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9
# cmake version > 3.12 is required; use "pip install -U cmake"
pip install admix-kit
```
