`admix-kit` is a Python library to faciliate analyses and methods development of genetics 
data from admixed populations.

This is designed to be a [python library](api.md) to faciliate analyzing admixed populations. 
We have also created [command line interface (CLI)](cli/index.md) for main functionalities.
